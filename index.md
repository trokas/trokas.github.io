## About

This website is mainly used as a TOC to add some structure around my experiments and posts, which can be used as learning/teaching resources.

## AI primer highlights

Ongoing course can be found in [AI primer](https://github.com/trokas/ai_primer) repo, but here I will highlight most important ideas.

**TODO**: add page which introduces FCN using SVD as base.
